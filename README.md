A work in progress (WIP) text user interface (TUI) for the terminal in Odin lang.

Based off of [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui) and built on top of [termbox2](https://github.com/termbox/termbox2)

TODO (short term):
  1) Finish implementing all the widgets from termui
  2) Finish examples from termui
  3) Update this readme with schreenshots
  4) Documentation

TODO (longer term):
  1) Implement the [State Action Model (SAM) API](https://www.infoq.com/articles/no-more-mvc-frameworks/)
  2) Look to [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui), [FTXui](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI), and [others](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for potential improvements
  3) Consider replacing termbox2 with a pure Odin terminal library
  4) Cross platform support (currently only works on Linux)

This project was originally created to support my text based multiplayer game [Esterian Conquest](https://github.com/greenm01/esterian-conquest)
